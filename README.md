## Description

The Push swap project is a simple yet highly structured algorithmic challenge where you need to sort data. 

## Instructions

## Ressources

One of the multiple ressources that helped me during this project was that one medium article talking about it and explaining [how to manipulate a stack](https://pure-forest.medium.com/push-swap-turk-algorithm-explained-in-6-steps-4c6650a458c0)

I didn't use any AI for this project.
